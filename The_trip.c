Input
Standard input will contain the information for several trips. Each trip consists of a
line containing a positive integer n denoting the number of students on the trip. This is
followed by n lines of input, each containing the amount spent by a student in dollars
and cents. There are no more than 1000 students and no student spent more than
$10,000.00. A single line containing 0 follows the information for the last trip.
Output
For each trip, output a line stating the total amount of money, in dollars and cents,
that must be exchanged to equalize the studentsâ€™ costs.
